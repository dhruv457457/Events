1. **Project Idea:** Your project aims to create a comprehensive online platform tailored for college students to enhance their academic and extracurricular activities. The website will provide a conducive environment for student success by offering a range of features:
   - Study Materials: Curated resources and study materials to aid in learning.
   - Roadmaps for Learning: Guided paths for students to learn coding languages, accompanied by progress tracking through a visual progress bar.
   - Practice Questions: Simple practice questions to reinforce learning.
   - Events Section: A curated list of hackathons and events relevant to students.
   - Community Section: A platform for students to post queries, share information about events, and engage with peers.
   - To-Do List: A feature to help students organize their tasks and manage their time effectively.
   - AI Tools Section: A collection of AI tools, including alternatives to paid ones, and GPT prompts to boost creativity and productivity.

2. **Problem Being Solved:** The project addresses several challenges faced by college students:
   - Lack of centralized resources: Many students struggle to find reliable study materials and guidance for learning new skills.
   - Difficulty in tracking progress: Without a structured approach, students may find it challenging to monitor their learning progress effectively.
   - Limited awareness of events: Students often miss out on valuable opportunities such as hackathons and workshops due to a lack of awareness.
   - Isolation in learning: Providing a community platform fosters collaboration and support among students.
   - Inefficient time management: The inclusion of a to-do list helps students better manage their time and prioritize tasks.

3. **Tech Stack:** The tech stack required for implementing your project may include:
   - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
   - Backend: Node.js, Express.js (or any other backend framework of your choice)
   - Database: MongoDB (or any other database management system)
   - User Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication
   - Progress Tracking: JavaScript libraries for implementing progress bars
   - Community Forum: Integration with a forum platform or building a custom solution using frameworks like React.js or Vue.js
   - AI Tools Section: Integration with APIs of AI tools, along with custom implementation for GPT prompts
   - Deployment: Platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean for hosting the web application
